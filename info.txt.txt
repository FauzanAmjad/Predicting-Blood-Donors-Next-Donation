Each donor is described by a number of variables. The significance of each is as follows:

R (Recency - months since last donation),
F (Frequency - total number of donation),
M (Monetary - total blood donated in c.c.),
T (Time - months since first donation), and
a binary variable representing whether he/she donated blood on the survey date (1 
stand for donating blood; 0 stands for not donating blood).
