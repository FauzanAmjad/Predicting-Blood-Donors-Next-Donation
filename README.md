# Predicting-Blood-Donors-Next-Donation

## Inspiration

I personally feel that computer science is underutilized in the healthcare field and has room for so much potential. Being someone that wants to expand the role of artificial intelligence in medicine, I felt inspired to pursue this challenge.

## What it does

The algorithm uses machine learning in Matlab to understand and predict whether or not a past donor will donate on a given day.

## How I built it

I used the k-nearest neighbors algorithm that allowed me to use regression and classification, and I built it with MatLab.

## Challenges I ran into

MatLab environment wasn't really straightforward in my opinion and it was difficult to navigate. I generally like to use Python or R when I do data science or machine learning, but luckily I learned the IDE and how powerful it can be.

## Accomplishments that I'm proud of

Learning MatLab and actually getting some aspect of my program to work at the end.

## What I learned

I learned different machine learning algorithms and which of those might not work for a certain scenario. I also extended my knowledge of how to navigate through the MatLab environment.

## What's next for Predicting Blood Donors' Next Donation

Learning more machine learning and deep learning algorithms that I can try out on datasets.
